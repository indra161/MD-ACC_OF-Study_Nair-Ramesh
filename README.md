Fig2Data.mat contains spiketimes and averaged calcium traces value for preshock, shock and postshock moments in OFF conditions.
Fig3Data.mat contains spiketimes and averaged calcium traces value for preshock, shock and postshock moments in OFF and ON conditions.
Fig4_RawData.xls contains values for Total freezing duration, Number of freezing bouts, Average duration of freezing bouts and Shock triggered feezing bouts.
CodeforSpikeandShockalignment_MS.m is a matlab file for spike extraction and alignment with shock and also provide a shuffling based algorithm to provide a timeshifted statistical analysis of the spikes.
Shock_BehaviorCode_MS.m , totalFreezingTimes_MS.m and Freezetimes_MS.m shows provides matlab codes for alignment of shock based time stamps with freezing along with freezing duration
